## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud)
- npm or yarn

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd car-rental-system
   ```

2. **Install all dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory:
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/car_rental_admin
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here_change_in_production
   NODE_ENV=development

4. **Start MongoDB**
   
   Make sure MongoDB is running on your system or configure cloud MongoDB URI.

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start both the server (port 5000) and client (port 3000) concurrently.

6. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: ${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL}
